## Control Challenges for C++
This repo is a set of control challenges made for FRC Team 1678 Citrus Circuits. These challenges are written in C++.

To get started:
 * Fork this repository on github
 * Clone it to your computer using `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/control-challenges`
 * Install [bazel](https://www.bazel.io)
 * Write controller code in `solutions`. The controllers have been stubbed out for you - all you have to do is implement
   them!
 * Run a challenge with `bazel run //challenges/<challenge-type>:<challenge>` (i.e. `bazel run
   //challenges/sliding_block:simple`)
